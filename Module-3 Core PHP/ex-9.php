<!-- "After $a = '1';, both $a and $b are '1'.
$b = &$a; makes $b a reference to $a, so changing one will affect the other.
$b = "2$b"; changes the value of $b to '21'.
Since $b is a reference to $a, any changes made to $b will reflect in $a as well.

Therefore, after executing the code:

$a will be '21'.
$b will also be '21', because it is a reference to $a.
So, the values of $a and $b after the code executes are both '21'."; -->
